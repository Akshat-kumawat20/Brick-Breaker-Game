# Brick-Breaker-Game
A classic Brick Breaker (Breakout) game built using Java and Swing, where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the bricks to win!

This is a simple 2D arcade-style game implemented entirely in Java. The goal is to destroy all the bricks by bouncing a ball using a paddle without letting the ball fall below the paddle. It's a fun project to practice Java GUI programming, object-oriented design, and basic game mechanics.
